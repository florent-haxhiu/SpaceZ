# SpaceZ

This is a solar system based site from planets to asteriods.

We had two days to complete this site based of an API of our choosing for one of our projects.

## What our site does

Our site is use to navigate through the solar systems many bodies (Comets, asteroids, dwarf planets, our sun and other planets). Through our site you will be able to see information regarding each planet in our solar system. Alongside this we have also added a list of every body in the system with its body type and various bits of information.
Creating this we use the [The Solar System OpenData API](https://api.le-systeme-solaire.net/rest/bodies/).
We started by using axios to get the information on the bodies and then organised the data within the site using a mixture of bootstrap and react elements.
